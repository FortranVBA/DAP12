# Soft Desk API application

Soft Desk API is a back-end application to be executed locally in the context of OpenClassroom educational project. It allow registered users to report and follow project related issues. Registered users can create projects, add project contributors, create project issues and create issue comments. This application has been developed with the Django rest framework, using SQlite database.

## Installation and first launch

This locally-executable application can be installed and executed from [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) using the following steps.

1. Clone this repository using $ git clone `https://github.com/FortranVBA/DAP10.git` (you can also download the code using [as a zip file](https://github.com/FortranVBA/DAP10/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
2. Move to the application root folder.
3. Create a virtual environment for the project with `$ py -m venv .venv` on windows or `$ python3 -m venv .venv` on macos or linux.
4. Activate the virtual environment with `$ .venv\Scripts\activate` on windows or `$ source .venv/bin/activate` on macos or linux.
5. Install project dependencies with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the server with `$ python manage.py runserver`

When the server is running after step 6 of the procedure, the Soft Desk API can be requested from endpoints starting with the following base URL: http://localhost:8000/.
Since authentification is made with JWT (Json Web Token), the use of postman is recommanded for the API request.


## Usage after installation

For subsequent launches of the application, you only have to execute the following steps from the root folder of the project:
1. Activate the virtual environment with `$ .venv\Scripts\activate` on windows or `$ source .venv/bin/activate` on macos or linux.
2. Run the server with `$ python manage.py runserver`

Once you have launched the server, the Soft Desk API can be requested from endpoints starting with the following base URL [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
Since authentification is made with JWT (Json Web Token), the use of postman is recommanded for the API request.
